    "This notebook will demonstrate, through increasingly complex scenarios, why it's (generally) advantageous to make \"safe\" passes while playing soccer. This is something I <em>totally</em> didn't get as a kid, but it's been on my mind a lot lately. \n",

    "I thought about throwing a GUI behind this, but that's a lot of work, so I'm leaving it as-is for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "My ultimate goal? To convince you (and myself) that making safe passes, not losing possession, and carefully making your way up the field is important; that the difference between an 80% pass completion rate and an 85% pass completion rate is significant, especially when everyone on the team is on board and goes for the higher pass completion rate.

Here's a small snippet of code that takes as input a person's pass completion rate (between 0 and 1) and uses a weighted random setup (#Ithinkthisworks) to determine if the pass was successful or not. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there are a lot of factors that determine if a pass is successful beyond the player's pass completion rate, but this is #SimpleSoccerSimulator, after all :) "

Assuming everyone on the team has the same pass completion rate of <code>R</code> (again, this is oversimplified, I know), this will calculate the chance of successfully completing N passes (first function) and introduce randomness in a simulation using the make_pass function above (second function).

    "> Since the landmark work of Reep and Benjamin (42), many studies have focused on goal scoring patterns in various national and international football tournaments. Reep and Benjamin (42) showed that approximately 80% of goals scored were the result of a short sequence of three or less passes and that 1 in 10 shots tend to lead to a goal. More recently, Hughes and Franks (21) showed that in the 1990 and 1994 World Cup tournaments 84% and 80% of goals respectively came from possessions of four or less passes. In addition, 80% and 77% of the shots at goal were a result of a sequence of four or less passes.\n",

    "Ok, so maybe you don't have to make <code>N</code> passes in a row in order to score, but I made this notebook before reading that, and you do (presumably) need to string together passes to make it down the field, so the following bit from that same site, which says that an overwhelming percentage of goals are scored from inside the penalty area, might help convince you that the rest of this exercise is interesting. \n",
    "> Other research has examined the position on the pitch from which goals are scored. In a recent study Wright et al. (50) showed that from 167 goals from English Premier League, 87% of goals were scored inside the penalty area which is similar to the 90% observed by Olsen (36) for the 1986 World Cup whereas Dufour (14) reported 80% for the 1990 World Cup. Yiannakos and Armatas (51) reported that 44.4% of goals scored were inside the penalty area, 35.2% inside the goal area, and 20.4% outside the penalty area, for the 2004 European Championship in Portugal. Finally, Hughes et al. (22) showed that successful teams in the 1986 Football World Cup made more attempts inside the penalty area in comparison to unsuccessful teams.\n",

Notice that the 5% difference between 95% completion and 90% completion results in 77% vs 59% chance of completing 5 passes; that means that with a 90% pass completion rate, your team only connects 5 passes 77% of the times that they would have connected 5 passes if everyone had a 95% completion rate. And with each player having an 80% pass completion rate, which still still <em>sounds</em> good until you get into this math ... you're more likely to lose the ball while making 5 passes than to actually connect 5 passes in a row!"
